The code should scan an integer from `stdin`, which is the number of iterations. Do it with `val n = readLine.toInt`.\r\nUse <ideone.com> to compile and test the code, and share the link after you have succeeded.\r\nYou can use `scala.util.Random` class in your code if you want:\r\n```scala\r\nimport scala.util.Random\r\n\r\nobject Main extends App {\r\n    val r = Random()\r\n    val n = readLine().toInt\r\n    ...\r\n    val someRandomDouble = r.nextDouble()  // generates a double between 0.0 and 1.0\r\n    ...\r\n    println(pi)\r\n}\r\n```",
